                    <h1> Military Brat: <em>A Journey Down Memory Lane</em> </h1>
            <p> My father was enlisted in the Air Force throughout my childhood,
                and I had the opportunity to move around quite a bit as a child. <br>
                When people learn this, I get the question, <h4>"So, where all have you lived?"</h4>
                Well, let me tell you... </p><br>
                <body>
                    <div>
                    <p> <h2> 1.) Anchorage, AK </h2>
                        Yes, yes, I know. I have been told there was two feet of snow on the ground the day I was born.</p>
                        <p> <h2><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/simpleview/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,h_800,q_50,w_1600/v1/clients/anchorage/anc-skyline-donna-dewhurst_resized_eca7ea3e-9d01-47b1-801e-8224b8d7bd1f.jpg"></h2>
                            I love that I was born in such a cool (pun definitely intended) place.  We left Alaska when I was a toddler, but I did get to go back when I was in grade school.  <br>
                            All I really recall from that trip was just how cold and beautiful it was. </p></div>

                            Living in Miami was amazing.  I remember regularly going to Naples Beach as a very small child, and playing outside nearly all of the time.  <br>
                            We also had a screened-in porch on the back of our house where we would watch the milder tropical storms go by.  </p></div>

                            I loved my time in Germany. Part of me will always consider it home as I spent six of my elementary school years there. <br>
                            We did so much sightseeing in our years there, and that coupled with living a bus and train ride away from so many different countries instilled in me a deep love of travel.<br>
                            My father went back to live in Germany while I was in college, and I had the opportunity to visit there five additional times! </p> </div>

                            I have grown up into adulthood in this area, and I have come to love St. Louis.  I have built a home and life here with my family, and I think I finally developed some roots.<br>
